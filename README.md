About
--------

Synct is a more advanced version of the now discontinued language B++. The developer of B++, Jackson Lewis, realized that the project had not scaled well and was riddled with bugs. Synct is developed with a more structural approach, better designed for actual coding than B++, which was more of a prototype. Synct gets it's name from a mashup of the words 'synced' and 'succint', because it's designed to be both consistent and quick to write and deploy.
